See the file LICENSE for details.

The primary output of the source here is the YAZ library, which
contains support functions for implementing the server or client
role of Z39.50 and SRW.

Windows programmers: refer to the file windows.txt which describes how
to build the software using Microsoft Visual C++.

On Unix, GNU configure is used to configure YAZ and generate Makefiles.
Type "./configure", then "make" to build YAZ.

Note: If you are using the CVS snapshot of YAZ you must have autoconf,
automake and libtool installed. Before running configure, create
support files by running buildconf.sh in the top-level directory of YAZ.  

In any case refer to the documentation in sub directory doc or read
it online at http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz/
