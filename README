Compilation and installation instructions for YAZ 
  $Id: README,v 1.36 2001-10-23 21:00:19 adam Exp $

The primary output of the source here is the lib/libyaz.a library,
which contains support functions for implementing the server or client
role of Z39.50.

Windows programmers: refer to the file windows.txt which describes how
to build the software using Microsoft Visual C++.

On Unix, GNU configure is used to configure YAZ and generate Makefiles.
Type "./configure", then "make" to build YAZ.

Note: If you are using the CVS snapshot of YAZ you must have autoconf,
automake and libtool installed. Before running configure, create
support files by running buildconf.sh in the top-level directory of YAZ.  

Two test-programs of interest are generated when you type 'make' at the
top level: ztest/yaz-ztest and client/yaz-client. Ztest is a dummy
database server which returns canned responses to all queries. It's good
for verifying that the protocol works ok, and ztest.c shows an
implementation of a 'backend' interface.

yaz-client is a linemode Z39.50 client. It supports a fair amount of the
functionality of Z39.50V3, but some things you need to enable or
disable by recompilation. Its primary purpose is to excersise the
package, and verify that the protocol works OK. It can be started by
typing

  yaz-client <hostname>[:<port>[/<database>]]

at the UNIX prompt, to connect to a Z39.50 server.

Use '?' to get a list of the available commands.

The current query language for the find command is a bit awkward, but
functional:

 query     ::= ['@attrset' <attribute-set>] rpn
 rpn       ::= complex | simple | attr rpn
 complex   ::= operator rpn rpn
 operator  ::= '@and' | '@or' | '@not' | '@prox' proximity
 simple    ::= term | set.
 term      ::= <word> | '"' <term> ... '"'.
 set       ::= '@set' <setname>.
 attr      ::= '@attr' [<attribute-set>] <number> '=' <number>.
 proximity ::= exclusion distance ordered relation which unit
 exclusion ::= '1' | '0' | 'void'
 distance  ::= <number>
 ordered   ::= '1' | '0'
 relation  ::= <number>
 which     ::= 'known' | 'private'
 unit      ::= <number>

Eg.:

 Andersen

 "Hans Andersen"

 @and @attr 1=1 andersen @attr 1=4 @attr 4=2 duckling

 @attrset Bib-1 @and @attr GILS 2=2008 Washington @attr 1=21 weather

The sort command takes a sequence of sort specifications. A sort
specification holds a field (sort criteria) and is followed by flags.
If the sort critieria includes = it is assumed that the sort SortKey
is of type sortAttributes using Bib-1. The integer before the = is
the attribute type and the integer following the = is the attribute
value. If no = is in the SortKey it is treated as a sortfield-type
of type InternationalString. Flags observed are s (sort case
sensitive), i (sort case insensitive), < (ascending), > (descending).
Eg.:
   1=4   i<                  (use is title, insensitive, ascending).
   Title s>                  (String Title, sensitive, descending).

The directories:

doc     - Documentation.

util    - Various little utility functions. Logging, memory debugging,
	primitive ISO 2709 presentation for the yaz-client, etc. You'll
	find the ASN.1 Compiler for YAZ here as well (yc.tcl).

odr	- Open Data Representation. This module implements the BER
	encoding rules. Documentation is found in the files odr-use.man
	and odr.txt.

z39.50  - CODECS for the Z39.50 protocol. This module does the same job
        as the old 'asn' module except that the source files are
        auto-generated using an YAZ' ASN.1 Compiler (yaz-comp).

zutil   - This module implements a collection of Z39.50 utilities, such
        as query parsing, etc.

ill     - This module implements the ISO ILL protocol.

comstack - This module implements the transport transparency
	stack (COMSTACK). The comstack implements a generic interface
	for exchanging BER-encoded records over a network. It supports
	the 'American' mode of exchanging the records straight over
	TCP/IP, and uses Peter Furniss' XTIMOSI package over RFC1006.
	Look for documentation in the file comstack.man.

zoom    - An implementation of Mike Taylors Z39.50 Object Oriented
        Model : ZOOM. If you'd like to build Z39.50 client applications
        in C this may be good start. You'll find example programs in 
        this directory too.

server  - This is the implementation of the server frontend. It
	provides event-handling and server managament functions,
	and calls the backend primitives (best documentation of these
	is in the file include/yaz/backend.h).

client  - A demonstration client for testing the protocol. It's bug'n
        ugly. But, it supports many features.

ztest   - A demonstration server that implements a backend.

include/yaz - The various header files.

lib     - The libraries. Primarily libyaz.a. The makefile gathers the
          libraries from previous modules into libyaz.a.
