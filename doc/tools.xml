 <chapter id="tools"><title>Supporting Tools</title>
  
  <para>
   In support of the service API - primarily the ASN module, which
   provides the pro-grammatic interface to the Z39.50 APDUs, &yaz; contains
   a collection of tools that support the development of applications.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="tools.query"><title>Query Syntax Parsers</title>

   <para>
    Since the type-1 (RPN) query structure has no direct, useful string
    representation, every origin application needs to provide some form of
    mapping from a local query notation or representation to a
    <token>Z_RPNQuery</token> structure. Some programmers will prefer to
    construct the query manually, perhaps using
    <function>odr_malloc()</function> to simplify memory management.
    The &yaz; distribution includes three separate, query-generating tools
    that may be of use to you.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="PQF"><title>Prefix Query Format</title>

    <para>
     Since RPN or reverse polish notation is really just a fancy way of
     describing a suffix notation format (operator follows operands), it
     would seem that the confusion is total when we now introduce a prefix
     notation for RPN. The reason is one of simple laziness - it's somewhat
     simpler to interpret a prefix format, and this utility was designed
     for maximum simplicity, to provide a baseline representation for use
     in simple test applications and scripting environments (like Tcl). The
     demonstration client included with YAZ uses the PQF.
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      The PQF have been adopted by other parties developing Z39.50
      software. It is often referred to as Prefix Query Notation
      - PQN.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     The PQF is defined by the pquery module in the YAZ library. 
     There are two sets of function that have similar behavior. First
     set operates on a PQF parser handle, second set doesn't. First set
     set of functions are more flexible than the second set. Second set
     is obsolete and is only provided to ensure backwards compatibility.
    </para>
    <para>
     First set of functions all operate on a PQF parser handle:
    </para>
    <synopsis>
     #include &lt;yaz/pquery.h&gt;

     YAZ_PQF_Parser yaz_pqf_create (void);

     void yaz_pqf_destroy (YAZ_PQF_Parser p);

     Z_RPNQuery *yaz_pqf_parse (YAZ_PQF_Parser p, ODR o, const char *qbuf);

     Z_AttributesPlusTerm *yaz_pqf_scan (YAZ_PQF_Parser p, ODR o,
                          Odr_oid **attributeSetId, const char *qbuf);


     int yaz_pqf_error (YAZ_PQF_Parser p, const char **msg, size_t *off);
    </synopsis>
    <para>
     A PQF parser is created and destructed by functions
     <function>yaz_pqf_create</function> and
     <function>yaz_pqf_destroy</function> respectively.
     Function <function>yaz_pqf_parse</function> parses query given
     by string <literal>qbuf</literal>. If parsing was successful,
     a Z39.50 RPN Query is returned which is created using ODR stream
     <literal>o</literal>. If parsing failed, a NULL pointer is
     returned.
     Function <function>yaz_pqf_scan</function> takes a scan query in 
     <literal>qbuf</literal>. If parsing was successful, the function
     returns attributes plus term pointer and modifies
     <literal>attributeSetId</literal> to hold attribute set for the
     scan request - both allocated using ODR stream <literal>o</literal>.
     If parsing failed, yaz_pqf_scan returns a NULL pointer.
     Error information for bad queries can be obtained by a call to
     <function>yaz_pqf_error</function> which returns an error code and
     modifies <literal>*msg</literal> to point to an error description,
     and modifies <literal>*off</literal> to the offset within last
     query were parsing failed.
    </para>
    <para>
     The second set of functions are declared as follows:
    </para>
    <synopsis>
     #include &lt;yaz/pquery.h&gt;

     Z_RPNQuery *p_query_rpn (ODR o, oid_proto proto, const char *qbuf);

     Z_AttributesPlusTerm *p_query_scan (ODR o, oid_proto proto,
                             Odr_oid **attributeSetP, const char *qbuf);

     int p_query_attset (const char *arg);
    </synopsis>
    <para>
     The function <function>p_query_rpn()</function> takes as arguments an
      &odr; stream (see section <link linkend="odr">The ODR Module</link>)
     to provide a memory source (the structure created is released on
     the next call to <function>odr_reset()</function> on the stream), a
     protocol identifier (one of the constants <token>PROTO_Z3950</token> and
     <token>PROTO_SR</token>), an attribute set reference, and
     finally a null-terminated string holding the query string.
    </para>
    <para>
     If the parse went well, <function>p_query_rpn()</function> returns a
     pointer to a <literal>Z_RPNQuery</literal> structure which can be
     placed directly into a <literal>Z_SearchRequest</literal>. 
     If parsing failed, due to syntax error, a NULL pointer is returned.
    </para>
    <para>
     The <literal>p_query_attset</literal> specifies which attribute set
     to use if the query doesn't specify one by the
     <literal>@attrset</literal> operator.
     The <literal>p_query_attset</literal> returns 0 if the argument is a
     valid attribute set specifier; otherwise the function returns -1.
    </para>

    <para>
     The grammar of the PQF is as follows:
    </para>

    <literallayout>
     query ::= top-set query-struct.

     top-set ::= &lsqb; '@attrset' string &rsqb;

     query-struct ::= attr-spec | simple | complex | '@term' term-type query

     attr-spec ::= '@attr' &lsqb; string &rsqb; string query-struct

     complex ::= operator query-struct query-struct.

     operator ::= '@and' | '@or' | '@not' | '@prox' proximity.

     simple ::= result-set | term.

     result-set ::= '@set' string.

     term ::= string.

     proximity ::= exclusion distance ordered relation which-code unit-code.

     exclusion ::= '1' | '0' | 'void'.

     distance ::= integer.

     ordered ::= '1' | '0'.

     relation ::= integer.

     which-code ::= 'known' | 'private' | integer.

     unit-code ::= integer.

     term-type ::= 'general' | 'numeric' | 'string' | 'oid' | 'datetime' | 'null'.
    </literallayout>

    <para>
     You will note that the syntax above is a fairly faithful
     representation of RPN, except for the Attribute, which has been
     moved a step away from the term, allowing you to associate one or more
     attributes with an entire query structure. The parser will
     automatically apply the given attributes to each term as required.
    </para>

    <para>
     The @attr operator is followed by an attribute specification 
     (<literal>attr-spec</literal> above). The specification consists
     of an optional attribute set, an attribute type-value pair and
     a sub-query. The attribute type-value pair is packed in one string:
     an attribute type, an equals sign, and an attribute value, like this:
     <literal>@attr 1=1003</literal>.
     The type is always an integer but the value may be either an
     integer or a string (if it doesn't start with a digit character).
     A string attribute-value is encoded as a Type-1 ``complex''
     attribute with the list of values containing the single string
     specified, and including no semantic indicators.
    </para>

    <para>
     Version 3 of the Z39.50 specification defines various encoding of terms.
     Use <literal>@term </literal> <replaceable>type</replaceable>
     <replaceable>string</replaceable>,
     where type is one of: <literal>general</literal>,
     <literal>numeric</literal> or <literal>string</literal>
     (for InternationalString).
     If no term type has been given, the <literal>general</literal> form
     is used.  This is the only encoding allowed in both versions 2 and 3
     of the Z39.50 standard.

    <para>
     Not all users enjoy typing in prefix query structures and numerical
     attribute values, even in a minimalistic test client. In the library
     world, the more intuitive Common Command Language - CCL (ISO 8777)
     has enjoyed some popularity - especially before the widespread
     availability of graphical interfaces. It is still useful in
     applications where you for some reason or other need to provide a
     symbolic language for expressing boolean query structures.
    </para>

    <para>
     The EUROPAGATE research project working under the Libraries programme
     of the European Commission's DG XIII has, amongst other useful tools,
     implemented a general-purpose CCL parser which produces an output
     structure that can be trivially converted to the internal RPN
     representation of &yaz; (The <literal>Z_RPNQuery</literal> structure).
     Since the CCL utility - along with the rest of the software
     produced by EUROPAGATE - is made freely available on a liberal
     license, it is included as a supplement to &yaz;.

    <sect3><title>CCL Qualifiers</title>
     
     <para>
      Qualifiers are used to direct the search to a particular searchable
      index, such as title (ti) and author indexes (au). The CCL standard
      itself doesn't specify a particular set of qualifiers, but it does
      suggest a few short-hand notations. You can customize the CCL parser
      to support a particular set of qualifiers to reflect the current target
      profile. Traditionally, a qualifier would map to a particular
      use-attribute within the BIB-1 attribute set. It is also
      possible to set other attributes, such as the structure
      attribute.
     </para>

     <para>
      A  CCL profile is a set of predefined CCL qualifiers that may be
      read from a file or set in the CCL API.
      The YAZ client reads its CCL qualifiers from a file named
      <filename>default.bib</filename>. There are four types of
      lines in a CCL profile: qualifier specification,
      qualifier alias, comments and directives.

     <sect4><title id="qualifier-specification">Qualifier specification</title>

       set (Bib-1 is used if no attribute set is given) and
       <replaceable>val</replaceable> is attribute value.
       The <replaceable>type</replaceable> can be specified as an
       integer or as it be specified either as a single-letter:
       <literal>u</literal> for use,

      All public definitions can be found in the header file

     </para>

     <para>
      To read a file containing qualifier definitions the function
      <function>ccl_qual_file</function> may be convenient. This function

     <para>
      which takes the CCL profile (<literal>bibset</literal>) and query
      (<literal>str</literal>) as input. Upon successful completion the RPN

      pointed to by <literal>error</literal> holds the error code and
      <literal>pos</literal> holds the offset inside query string in which
      the parsing failed.
     </para>

     <para>
      An English representation of the error may be obtained by calling
      the <literal>ccl_err_msg</literal> function. The error codes are
      listed in <filename>ccl.h</filename>.
     </para>

     <para>
      To convert the CCL RPN tree (type

      must be used. This function which is part of YAZ is implemented in
      <filename>yaz-ccl.c</filename>.
      After calling this function the CCL RPN tree is probably no longer
      needed. The <literal>ccl_rpn_delete</literal> destroys the CCL RPN tree.
     </para>

     <para>
      A CCL profile may be destroyed by calling the
      <function>ccl_qual_rm</function> function.
     </para>

     <para>
      The token names for the CCL operators may be changed by setting the

      <literal>ccl_token_and</literal>, <literal>ccl_token_or</literal>,
      <literal>ccl_token_not</literal> and <literal>ccl_token_set</literal>.
      An operator may have aliases, i.e. there may be more than one name for
      the operator. To do this, separate each alias with a space character.

    <sect3 id="tools.cql.pqf"><title>CQL to PQF conversion</title>
     <para>
      Conversion to PQF (and Z39.50 RPN) is tricky by the fact
      that the resulting RPN depends on the Z39.50 target
      capabilities (combinations of supported attributes). 
      In addition, the CQL and SRW operates on index prefixes
      (URI or strings), whereas the RPN uses Object Identifiers
      for attribute sets.
     </para>
     <para>
      The CQL library of &yaz; defines a <literal>cql_transform_t</literal>
      type. It represents a particular mapping between CQL and RPN.
      This handle is created and destroyed by the functions:
     <synopsis>
cql_transform_t cql_transform_open_FILE (FILE *f);
cql_transform_t cql_transform_open_fname(const char *fname);
void cql_transform_close(cql_transform_t ct);
      </synopsis>
      The first two functions create a tranformation handle from
      either an already open FILE or from a filename respectively.
     </para>
     <para>
      The handle is destroyed by <function>cql_transform_close</function> 
      in which case no further reference of the handle is allowed.
     </para>
     <para>
      When a <literal>cql_transform_t</literal> handle has been created
      you can convert to RPN.
      <synopsis>
int cql_transform_buf(cql_transform_t ct,
                      struct cql_node *cn, char *out, int max);
      </synopsis>
      This function converts the CQL tree <literal>cn</literal> 
      using handle <literal>ct</literal>.
      For the resulting PQF, you supply a buffer <literal>out</literal>
      which must be able to hold at at least <literal>max</literal>
      characters.
     </para>
     <para>
      If conversion failed, <function>cql_transform_buf</function>
      returns a non-zero SRW error code; otherwise zero is returned
      (conversion successful).  The meanings of the numeric error
      codes are listed in the SRW specifications at
      <ulink url="http://www.loc.gov/srw/diagnostic-list.html"/>
     </para>
     <para>
      If conversion fails, more information can be obtained by calling
      <synopsis>
int cql_transform_error(cql_transform_t ct, char **addinfop);
      </synopsis>
      This function returns the most recently returned numeric
      error-code and sets the string-pointer at
      <literal>*addinfop</literal> to point to a string containing
      additional information about the error that occurred: for
      example, if the error code is 15 (``Illegal or unsupported index
      set''), the additional information is the name of the requested
      index set that was not recognised.
     </para>
     <para>
      The SRW error-codes may be translated into brief human-readable
      error messages using
      <synopsis>
const char *cql_strerror(int code);
      </synopsis>
     </para>
     <para>
      If you wish to be able to produce a PQF result in a different
      way, there are two alternatives.
      <synopsis>
void cql_transform_pr(cql_transform_t ct,
                      struct cql_node *cn,
                      void (*pr)(const char *buf, void *client_data),
                      void *client_data);

int cql_transform_FILE(cql_transform_t ct,
                       struct cql_node *cn, FILE *f);
      </synopsis>
      The former function produces output to a user-defined
      output stream. The latter writes the result to an already
      open <literal>FILE</literal>.

     </para>
     <para>
      An RPN pattern is a simple attribute list. Each attribute pair

          This pattern is invoked when a CQL qualifier, such as

          and <replaceable>name</replaceable> is the index set and qualifier
          name respectively.

    The basic YAZ representation of an OID is an array of integers,
    terminated with the value -1. The &odr; module provides two
    utility-functions to create and copy this type of data elements:
   </para>

   <screen>
    Odr_oid *odr_getoidbystr(ODR o, char *str);
   </screen>

   <para>
    Creates an OID based on a string-based representation using dots (.)
    to separate elements in the OID.
   </para>

   <screen>
    Odr_oid *odr_oiddup(ODR odr, Odr_oid *o);
   </screen>

   <para>
    Creates a copy of the OID referenced by the <emphasis>o</emphasis>
    parameter.
    Both functions take an &odr; stream as parameter. This stream is used to
    allocate memory for the data elements, which is released on a
    subsequent call to <function>odr_reset()</function> on that stream.
   </para>

   <para>
    The OID module provides a higher-level representation of the

    The function
   </para>

   <screen>
    struct oident *oid_getentbyoid(int *o);

   <para>
    takes as argument an OID, and returns a pointer to a static area
    containing an <literal>oident</literal> structure. You typically use
    this function when you receive a PDU containing an OID, and you wish
    to branch out depending on the specific OID value.

    The function
   </para>

   <screen>
    int *oid_ent_to_oid(struct oident *ent, int *dst);

   <para>
    Takes as argument an <literal>oident</literal> structure - in which
    the <literal>proto</literal>, <literal>oclass</literal>/, and
    <literal>value</literal> fields are assumed to be set correctly -
    and returns a pointer to a the buffer as given by <literal>dst</literal>
    containing the base
    representation of the corresponding OID. The function returns
    NULL and the array dst is unchanged if a mapping couldn't place.
    The array <literal>dst</literal> should be at least of size
    <literal>OID_SIZE</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>

    The <function>oid_ent_to_oid()</function> function can be used whenever
    you need to prepare a PDU containing one or more OIDs. The separation of
    the <literal>protocol</literal> element from the remainder of the
    OID-description makes it simple to write applications that can
    communicate with either Z39.50 or OSI SR-based applications.

    The function
   </para>

   <screen>
    oid_value oid_getvalbyname(const char *name);

   </para>

   <para>
    Three utility functions are provided for translating OIDs'
    symbolic names (e.g. <literal>Usmarc</literal> into OID structures
    (int arrays) and strings containing the OID in dotted notation
    (e.g. <literal>1.2.840.10003.9.5.1</literal>).  They are:
   </para>

   <screen>
    int *oid_name_to_oid(oid_class oclass, const char *name, int *oid);
    char *oid_to_dotstring(const int *oid, char *oidbuf);
    char *oid_name_to_dotstring(oid_class oclass, const char *name, char *oidbuf);
   </screen>

   <para>
    <literal>oid_name_to_oid()</literal>
     translates the specified symbolic <literal>name</literal>,
     interpreted as being of class <literal>oclass</literal>.  (The
     class must be specified as many symbolic names exist within
     multiple classes - for example, <literal>Zthes</literal> is the
     symbolic name of an attribute set, a schema and a tag-set.)  The
     sequence of integers representing the OID is written into the
     area <literal>oid</literal> provided by the caller; it is the
     caller's responsibility to ensure that this area is large enough
     to contain the translated OID.  As a convenience, the address of
     the buffer (i.e. the value of <literal>oid</literal>) is
     returned.
   </para>
   <para>
    <literal>oid_to_dotstring()</literal>
    Translates the int-array <literal>oid</literal> into a dotted
    string which is written into the area <literal>oidbuf</literal>
    supplied by the caller; it is the caller's responsibility to
    ensure that this area is large enough.  The address of the buffer
    is returned.
   </para>
   <para>
    <literal>oid_name_to_dotstring()</literal>
    combines the previous two functions to derive a dotted string
    representing the OID specified by <literal>oclass</literal> and
    <literal>name</literal>, writing it into the buffer passed as
    <literal>oidbuf</literal> and returning its address.
   </para>

   <para>
    Finally, the module provides the following utility functions, whose
    meaning should be obvious:
   </para>

   <screen>
    void oid_oidcpy(int *t, int *s);
    void oid_oidcat(int *t, int *s);
    int oid_oidcmp(int *o1, int *o2);
    int oid_oidlen(int *o);
   </screen>

   <note>
    <para>
     The OID module has been criticized - and perhaps rightly so
     - for needlessly abstracting the
     representation of OIDs. Other toolkits use a simple
     string-representation of OIDs with good results. In practice, we have
     found the interface comfortable and quick to work with, and it is a
     simple matter (for what it's worth) to create applications compatible
     with both ISO SR and Z39.50. Finally, the use of the
     <literal>/oident</literal> database is by no means mandatory.
     You can easily create your own system for representing OIDs, as long
     as it is compatible with the low-level integer-array representation
     of the ODR module.

  <sect1 id="tools.nmem"><title>Nibble Memory</title>

   <para>
    Sometimes when you need to allocate and construct a large,
    interconnected complex of structures, it can be a bit of a pain to
    release the associated memory again. For the structures describing the
    Z39.50 PDUs and related structures, it is convenient to use the
    memory-management system of the &odr; subsystem (see
    <xref linkend="odr.use"/>). However, in some circumstances
    where you might otherwise benefit from using a simple nibble memory
    management system, it may be impractical to use
    <function>odr_malloc()</function> and <function>odr_reset()</function>.
    For this purpose, the memory manager which also supports the &odr;
    streams is made available in the NMEM module. The external interface
    to this module is given in the <filename>nmem.h</filename> file.
   </para>

   <para>
    The following prototypes are given:
   </para>

   <screen>
    NMEM nmem_create(void);
    void nmem_destroy(NMEM n);
    void *nmem_malloc(NMEM n, int size);
    void nmem_reset(NMEM n);
    int nmem_total(NMEM n);
    void nmem_init(void);
    void nmem_exit(void);
   </screen>

   <para>
    The <function>nmem_create()</function> function returns a pointer to a
    memory control handle, which can be released again by
    <function>nmem_destroy()</function> when no longer needed.
    The function <function>nmem_malloc()</function> allocates a block of
    memory of the requested size. A call to <function>nmem_reset()</function>
    or <function>nmem_destroy()</function> will release all memory allocated
    on the handle since it was created (or since the last call to
    <function>nmem_reset()</function>. The function
    <function>nmem_total()</function> returns the number of bytes currently
    allocated on the handle.
   </para>

   <para>
    The nibble memory pool is shared amongst threads. POSIX
    mutex'es and WIN32 Critical sections are introduced to keep the
    module thread safe. Function <function>nmem_init()</function>
    initializes the nibble memory library and it is called automatically
    the first time the <literal>YAZ.DLL</literal> is loaded. &yaz; uses
    function <function>DllMain</function> to achieve this. You should
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> call <function>nmem_init</function> or
    <function>nmem_exit</function> unless you're absolute sure what
    you're doing. Note that in previous &yaz; versions you'd have to call
    <function>nmem_init</function> yourself.
