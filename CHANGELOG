--- XXXX 1995/XX/XX

Fixed bug in the frontend-server. The numberOfRecordsReturned field was
handled incorrectly when records were requested in the searchResponse. This
will only affect you if you use the frontend-server.

Added Explain encoders/decoders to the service-level API. Untested.

Added GRS-1 encoders/decoders to the service-level API. Lightly tested.
Test-client will ask for and ODR pretty-print GRS1. Ztest will return
dummy records.

Moved pretty-printing of structure-wrappers ({..}) from odr_seq.c to
odr_cons.c, which causes a more correct output.

Fixed handling of searchRequest in frontend server. NextResultSetPosition
was always set to 0 when no records were requested in the searchRequest.

* Added better external-handling. This shouldn't harm old code that *encodes*
externals. It will break code that looks for a 'single-ASN1-type'
representation, since those types that are known are now decoded
immediately. Look at the SUTRS sample code in seshigh.c and client.c.
Documentation updated.

Fairly quick maintenance release to add SUTRS support.

Fixed handling of SUTRS records in the demonstration client.

* Added format field to the bend_fetchrequest and bend_fetchresponce
structures of the backend API (frontend server). When the record is
returned, the value of the format field is mapped to an OID. The
value VAL_SUTRS will also cause a slightly different ASN.1 packaging
of the record. The special value VAL_NONE in the bend_request means
that no specific format was requested by the client. Documentation
updated accordingly. Test server (ztest) will return a fixed dummy
SUTRS record if your client requests SUTRS.

Documentation updated accordingly.

You can now set external libraries and RANLIB support in the top-level
Makefile.
