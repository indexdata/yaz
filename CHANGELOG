Possible compatibility problems with earlier versions marked with '*'.

--- 1.8.6 2002/MM/DD

Added patch by Rustam T. Usmanov that implements Z39.50 duplicate
detection service (Z39.50-1995 Amendment 2) and Language Negotiation (3).
See:
 http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/amend/am2.html
 http://lcweb.loc.gov/z3950/agency/defns/charneg-3.html

--- 1.8.5 2002/02/03

New YAZ client features: Command completion and new commands:
push_command, set_apdufile, set_marcdump, set_cclfields, register_oid.
Code provided by Jacob Poulsen.

New call oid_trav, that visits all registered OIDs via callback.

Function ZOOM_record_get now returns const char pointer rather than
void pointer. It saves a lot of type casts.

For YAZ client, command "auth" now allows you to set authentication
in IdPass style. It is enabled when three tokens are given - order
is user, group and password.

Fix memory leaks in MARC record handling for ZOOM.

New option for YAZ client, -k <kilobytes> that sets
maximum record size. Similar to -k option for generic frontend
server and yaz-ztest.

More fixes for scan. Non-zero stepSize handled. OID's fixes.

Prefix query parser reports "fail" when bad attribute set is given.

Fix in MARC decoder. Proximity logging. Fix for attribute set
in scan handler for server. Patches by Shigeru Ishida.

SSL/COMSTACK updates. cs_rcvconnect completes SSL handshake. ZOOM
works with SSL.

Configure option --with-openssl=<dir> now works when a directory is
specified. Patch provided by Morten Bøgeskov.

New option for YAZ client, -u <auth>, that sets authentication.

ZOOM fix: error information was sometimes "missing", since error
was cleared/reset too when it shouldn't.

ZOOM_record_get returns ISO2709 buffer when "raw" is given.

--- 1.8.4 2002/01/04

Scan for ZOOM API. New object ZOOM_scanset. New functions
ZOOM_connection_scan, ZOOM_scanset_size, ZOOM_scanset_term and
ZOOM_scanset_destroy.

New ZOOM function, ZOOM_connection_last_event, that returns type
of last event (such as "receive data", "send data", "apdu received",
etc.

New ZOOM option, schema, that specifies shema OID for retrieval.

New CCL feature. Qualifiers can be aliases for one or more
other qualifiers (if more than one is given, OR is used).

ZOOM uses named result sets if target supports it.

Two new YAZ client commands: .  (dot, which sources a script of YAZ
client commands), and ! (to execute shell command.). Implemented
by Jacob Poulsen.

Working on Debian packages.

--- 1.8.3 2001/11/19

YAZ client enables named result sets only if target supports it.

*** ZOOM. Prefix for ZOOM definitions changed from Z3950_ to ZOOM_.

* ZOOM. Removed Z3950_connection_host. Use Z3950_connection_option_get
with key="host" to get same result.

* ZOOM. Added Z3950_record_clone and removed Z3950_resultset_get.
Function Z3950_resultset_record(s) returns references to records
"owned" by resultset. To become owner use Z3950_record_clone.

Function z_ext_record handles Extended Services. Thanks to
Irina Dijour.

--- 1.8.2 2001/11/12

CCL Parser fix: ignore token comma when dealing with and-lists.

Documentation updates for COMSTACK.

* ZOOM changes. Query object renamed from Z3950_search to Z3950_query.
Changed prototype Z3950_records. For some functions, int parameters
were changed to size_t.

TCP/IP COMSTACK no longer uses getprotobyname to avoid memory leak
on some Unices.

New MARC decode/display function, marc_display_exl, which properly rejects
non-ISO2709 records. YAZ client uses it.

--- 1.8.1 2001/10/29

Fix bug: local attribute set wasn't set correctly in PQF strings.

--- 1.8 2001/10/25

* Old Z39.50 codecs no longer supported. 

Added ZOOM C binding. See http://zoom.z3950.org/

Renamed states for COMSTACKs to avoid confusion with events.

Implemented cs_look and proper cs_rcvconnect.

Fixed COMSTACK error that occurred on HPUX. Fix by Giannis Kosmas.

Configure detects POSIX threads on OpenBSD.

When sort flag 'i' was specified in yaz-client the caseSensitivy flag
was set to a wrong value.  Thanks to Robert Sanderson for reporting this.

When error is returned from present handler, non-surrogate diagnostic
is returned in present response (and fetch handler is no longer called).

* Minor adjustments to pquery parser (PQF). Token characters may be
escaped by using backslash (C-style).

PQF parser allows string attribute values to be specified. For @attr,
non-numeric characters after the equal-sign are treated as strings
(e.g. @attr 9=title).

CCL trunction character may be defined (@truncation in file)

* function zget_ExtendedServicesRequest sets waitAction to
  waitIfPossible (was wait).

Added cs_set_blocking to set change blocking mode of a COMSTACK. Thanks
to Matthew Carey.

CCL operator names may be set in field definition files (CCL_bibset).
See ccl/bib1 for an example.

Fixes in ASN.1 compiler for C++ compatibility.

* Renamed members "and" and "or" in struct Z_Operator to "op_and"
and "op_or" to avoid conflict with C++.

Fixed problem with GNU readline detection on Redhat 7.0.

Added step-size for Scan backend handler.

Fixed bug that made the frontend server crash when no attribute
set was specified for scan.

Front-end server automatically switches to original working directory
when installed as an NT service. Previously -w had to be specified to
make it work.

Added extended attributes for retrieval module (data1), so that data1
records carry d1_readXML/SGML attributes. d1_read also supports
null-data rules ( <tag/>)

On UNIX when POSIX threads are available, a separate library libyazthread
is created. Programmers should link with that library and the yaz library
when using threads. The reason for the split was that some applications
on Linux, such as Apache, doesn't work well when using shared objects that
relies on threads.

Added SSL support for the COMSTACK. You start yaz-client and yaz-ztest
(or any frontend server) in SSL mode by specifying ssl: followed by
address. Only tested on UNIX.

Added feature for CCL module. Virtual structure s=al or s=ol generates
and-list and or-list respectively instead of phrase search.

Added some OID's.

* Added prefix "yaz_" for the functions log_init.., log_file..  and
log_mask_str. This was done to avoid name conflicts with other libraries
(such as other PHP extensions).

Added raw OID member for preferred record syntax (request_format_raw)
and returned record syntax (output_format_raw) for backend fetch method.

Config file yaz-config now accepts options so that it returns specific
compile settings, etc. Thanks to Morten Bøgeskov <morten@bogeskov.dk>

Shared library support for UNIX using GNU libtool.

* Modified backend interface. Request/Response struct's replaced by
one read/write C struct. For example bend_fetchrequest and
bend_fetchresult have been replaced by single bend_fetch_rr struct.
Every handler - even search has to be registered in bend_init
handler. This means that the YAZ library no longer refers to
external functions and it makes it possible to make the whole
thing a single DLL/SO.

Added Segment handler for backend server.

Added Zmbol/Zebra administrative functions to YAZ client.

Threaded frontend server on UNIX (when POSIX Threads are available).
Starting the server with option -T enables multi-threading.

--- 1.6 2000/03/03

Added configure option --enable-comp/disable-comp to control use
of YAZ ASN.1 compiler. Use --disable-comp to use the old *coders
located in sub directory asn.

YAZ ASN.1 compiler renamed to yaz-comp in sub directory. It's installed
in ${exec_prefix}/bin along with the other programs yaz-client and
yaz-ztest.

GNU automake used to maintain makefiles.

Added several OID's.

Changed retrieval module so that we can load records with no abstract
syntax defined. Tagpaths in these records are fully composed of string
tags.

Implemented ISO ILL protocol. Refer to stuff in sub directory ill.

--- 1.5 1999/12/10

On UNIX, the generated makefile now supports a proper 'make install'.
The prefix can be set via GNU configure to set the install location
(default is /usr/local).

* YAZ programs client and ztest were renamed to yaz-client and
yaz-ztest to avoid conflicts when users install YAZ in "standard"
locations, such as /usr/bin,/usr/local/bin,etc.

* YAZ Header files were moved from include to include/yaz. YAZ Header
files are referred to as include <yaz/log.h> rather than <log.h>.
The YAZ include path (-I ..) is therefore the same as before. Programmers
should update their #include statements or use -Ipath/include/yaz
instead. The main motivation for doing this change is that YAZ header files
can be installed in "standard" locations /usr/include,/usr/local/include 
without introducing conflicts, since ALL YAZ header files are stored
in subdirectory yaz (under /usr/include for example).

Compilation of YAZ for WIN32 is now handled by an nmake-style makefile 
rather than project/workspace files. We switched because project files
are incompatible between Visual C++ 5 and 6. Refer to windows.txt for
details.

Changed name of logging function, logf, to yaz_log, to prevent name
clash with some math-log functions. The YAZ header log.h defines logf
to yaz_log (#define) so there should be no incompatibilities by this
modification.

Added bend_start/bend_stop handlers for server. These handler are
called on start/stop of server. For windows they are called whenever
a service is started/stopped.

* YAZ now auto-generates decoders/encoders for the Z39.50 protocol using
a fairly small ASN.1 compiler written in Tcl. The compiler is located
in util/yc.tcl. The auto-generated C code structures are, in a few
cases, incompatible with the old decoders. There are differences in the
following C structures Z_DiagRec, Z_External, Z_SortRequest, Z_SortResponse,
Z_AttributesPlusTerm, Z_ProximityOperator, Z_DefaultDiagFormat.
The preprocessor variable ASN_COMPILED is defined when the compiled
ASN.1 is being used. Encoder/decoder routines as well as the Z39.50
protocol ASN.1 is located sub directory <tt>z39.50</tt>. If you
wish to use the old encoders/decoders you can specify --disable-yc
for configure.

Assigned OID for old DB Update (VAL_DBUPDATE0). Updated YAZ compiled
version so that it supports both new - and old version of DB Update

* Added 'name' parameter to ODR encoder/decoder routines to facilitate
pretty ODR print. Updated whole Z39.50 encoder/decoder to reflect the
change. The name parameter can be set to 0 in which no name is specified
for the construction. The macros odr_implicit and odr_explicit sets name
parameter to zero for the construction involved. New macros
odr_implicit_tag and odr_explicit_tag are similar to the others,
except that a name parameter is added. For programmers' that don't use
ODR they probably only need to change the call to z_APDU and z_External.

Added access control facility by interfacing the TCP wrapper library.
YAZ automatically attempts to find the TCP wrapper Library (-lwrap) and
tcpd.h on Unix systems. For the server, option -d<daemon> specifies the
name of the daemon and enables the access control as specified in
hosts.allow/hosts.deny. Refer to man pages tcpd(8) and hosts_access(5).

Fixed memory leak in ccl_find_str and ccl_qual_rm. Thanks to Hans van
den Dool <H.M.vdnDool@kub.nl>.

Added reference ID parameter to most functions in server API - refer
to backend.h. Thanks to Hans van den Dool <H.M.vdnDool@kub.nl>.

Changed name of ccl library to libccl.a (was ccl.a).

Fixed bug in decoder for Explain (Category TargetInfo).

Added support for GNU readline in client. Thanks to Jacob Poulsen
<ja7@dbc.dk>. GNU configure attempts to detect if readline is available.

* CHANGED DEFINITION OF ES: UPDATE (INCLUDING THE OID) to reflect the
new definition from the ZIG. NOTE THIS IF YOU HAVE AN UPDATE
IMPLEMENTATION! This change was made to the development version before
the ZIG decided to retract the amendment. If any users MUST be
compatible with the original Update definition, PLEASE CONTACT US, and
we will include a separate definition corresponding to the old Update
ES. Note that because of the change to the ASN.1 of the
TaskPackageRecordStructure we cannot define a single structure that
will support both versions.

* Added const modifier to buffer parameter for some ODR/BER encoding
routines: ber_dectag, ber_declen, odp_more_chunks, completeBER,
completeWAIS, odr_dumpBER.

Fixed bug in client.c which caused a crash when a scanResponse didn't
contain positionOfTerm.

* Fixed inconsistency in the ScanResponse/ListEntries protocol. This
* will cause an error in a client if a non-YAZ target sends both a
* list of Scan entries and non-surrogate diagnostics.

Retrieval module enhancements. Tag sets may be typed in the reference
to it. From the .abs-file the "tagset" directive takes a third optional
integer type for the tag set referenced. From a .tag-file the "include"
directive takes a third optional type as well. The old "type" directive
in the tag set itself is still recognized but acts as the default type
for the tag set.

Backend interface change. Individual Scan terms returned from bend_scan
may also be tagged as Surrogate Diagnostics. Refer to struct scan_entry
in include/backend.h.

Retrieval module enhancements. Multiple tag sets and attribute sets may
be specified in abstract syntax specs. Revised the error/warning for
logging messages reported by the retrieval module when reading the
various spec files.

Object Identifier system (oid_..) changed. The API is backwards
compatible but the oid-routines now allocates new OID's when needed.
Raw OID's may be specified in oid_getvalbyname.

YAZ now uses GNU configure to generate Makefile(s).

* Minor changes in some of the member names of DeleteResultSetRequest and
DeleteResultSetResponse. See include/proto.h.

* Changed some C definitions regarding EXPLAIN record syntax (prt-exp.h)
and added member 'languages' in TargetInfo (which was missing).

Changed the way attribute sets are handled in the retrieval
module. These are now cached, just like the abstract syntaxes
(schemas).

Changed YAZ so that it links with compiled ASN.1.

Added Explain-schema definitions and mapping routines. The following
Explain categories have been implemented: AttributeDetails,
AttributeSetInfo, DatabaseInfo, CategoryList and TargetInfo.

Fixed minor bug in Windows version of Server Library.

--- 1.4pl2+ 1998/4/17 (Released with Zebra)

Added Extended Services to server (backend.h). Thanks to Charles Woodfield.

Added EXTERNAL: UNIverse Resource Report (non-standard).

Implemened odr_enum and odr_set_of functions to handle ASN.1 types
ENUMERATED and SET OF.

* Added 'const' to some of the char pointer arguments for the
functions, data1_read_node, data1_getelementbytagname,
data1_insert_taggeddata, data1_getesetbyname, data1_getelementbyname,
data1_get_absyn.

Fixed bug in data1_insert_taggeddata - the last_child member of
parent wasn't initialised.

* Changed data1_read_record and data1_read_node so that the supplied
"SGML"-buffer is read-only. In particular the resulting data1 - tree
doesn't refer to any parts of the "SGML"-buffer.

Fixed bug in server library (Windows version of statserv_remove).

* Changed code so that it compiles as C++. The type definition
of Odr_fun which is a member of Odr_arm was changed. The result is,
that an explicit typecast is needed for the fun pointer when
using Odr_arm - as in:
    {1, -1, -1, Z_IdAuthentication_idPass, (Odr_fun)z_IdPass},

Updated TagSet-G and -M definitions (tagsetm.tag and tagsetg.tag).

Implemented the new structured date and time definition as approved
by the ZIG. Added schemaId element to the specificTag in Espec-1
(also approved at the last ZIG). Thanks to RVDM.

Added some Object identifiers (RVDM).

Changed the Update Extended Service (RVDM).

Added command "refid" to client which specifies referenceId for
the following requests.

Implemented extended service handling for server. See ztest.c
for an example as well as backend.h. New handlers are registerd
in the Init handler.

* Changed interface for sort in server.

Added new members to statserv_options_block. It allows a server
to read options from another source than just the command line. Thanks
to Charles Woodfield.

* Changed definition of Z_Triple in file prt-grs.h - member boolean
renamed to zboolean. Some C++ compilers complained about the name.

Minor changes to gils.abs. Added index 's' (sort) on title
and date/time-last-modified.

--- 1.4pl2 1998/1/30

Fixed bug in server library regarding inetd mode (-i). This bug
was introduced by release 1.4.

--- 1.4pl1 1998/1/29

Added sort facility in client and backend server interface.

Fixed problem with dependencies in Makefile(s).

Fixed bugs for encoders/decoders of extended services and 
SearchInfoReport.

Implemented sub-tree feature for schemas. Sub-trees are
referenced in *.abs-files. See explain.abs for an example
of the use of this feature.

Modified bib1.att; local attributes for ANY didn't include
ANY itself (only affects use of the retrieval module).

Fixed bug in plain SGML reader in function data1_read_node:
tags with prefix "var" was incorrectly interpreted as variants.

Added feature "sub-schemas" to enable references to - and definitions
of - group of elements.

* Removed member parent from type data1_element (in data1.h).

Implemented function odr_nullval() that returns the value of
ODR_NULLVAL.

* Removed member num_children from data1_node (in data1.h).

Made NT service interface part of the server library. The
function statserv_main uses the NT service when required and
calls the statserv_start / statserv_close routines.

Routine zget_SearchRequest and zget_PresentRequest fills
resultSetName/Id member with "default" instead of "Default".

Fixed memory leak in server. Request queue member wasn't freed.

Fixed nmem_exit so that memory is freed.

--- 1.4 1997/10/2

Revised the CCL parser utility to be thread safe.

Added function, oid_ent_to_oid, to replace the function 
oid_getoidbyent, which is not thread safe.

* Added nmem_init and nmem_exit to initialize and release
NMEM resources. Function nmem_init should be called once in the
initial thread before NMEM/ODR is used. statserv.c and client.c
have been changed accordingly. The change was necessary to make
NMEM thread safe. The NMEM memory pool is shared amongst threads
in a process. Unix-based applications will still work fine without
calling this.

Added NT Services interface for the the Z39.50 (statserv) Server. 
Refer to the ztest.c source on the usage.

Windows 95/NT port using MSVC5.0. Project files are included in the
distribution.

* Defined new 'global' handle for the retrieval (data1) system. The
new handled, data1_handle, describes the state of the data1 system.
This handle is passed as first argument to virtually all
data1 related routines. The functions data1_create and data1_destroy
creates and destroys a data1 handle respectively.

Added ODR encode stream member to all backend request structures
init, search, scan etc. This stream should be used to allocate all
memory used for the response when thread safe operation is needed.

Changed the comstack utility, cs_addstr, to be thread safe. The
returned hostname string returned by the function is now part the
COMSTACK instance.

Added comstack utility, cs_straddr, which replaces the tcpip_strtoaddr
function. The cs_straddr takes a COMSTACK handle as argument, so this
function must be used after cs_create and before bind/connect.
This function is thread safe.

Moved test server to 'ztest' directory - generic server code still
in 'server' directory.

Made prefix query (pquery.c) utility thread safe.

Added new function modifier YAZ_EXPORT to 'export' public DLL
functions when using windows (see include/yconfig.h).

Added definitions to the OID database (util/oid.c) (RVDM).

Added new BIB-1 diagnostic messages to the handler diagbib1_str.

Added call to ccl_rpn_delete in client program.

Added ODR argument to ccl_rpn_query and ccl_scan_query to provide
release of RPN structure.

Added support for C++, headers uses extern "C" for public definitions.
With input from RVDM.

In handling of SEQUENCE OF: Counter set to zero when SEQUENCE OF is absent.
Thanks to Ronald van der Meer (RVDM).

Added initializers (zget_ routines) for a number of PDUs. Thanks to RVDM.

Added support for private extensions to the OID database
(oid_setprivateoids()). Thanks to RVDM.
    
Added optional, physical ANY (key replication)

Fixed null-reference problem in GRS-1 output filter.

Proximity operator added to Prefix Query Format (PQF).

In test client command "base" accepts multiple databases.

Fixed bug in cs_close stack that caused trouble with WINSOCK.

--- 1.3 1996/10/11

Fixed tagging bug in ResourceReportResponse PDU encoder/decode.

Smallish bug-fixes in the new encoders/decoders (explain).

Bug fixed in DeleteRequest.

Fixed tagging bug of type 101 query in SearchRequest-Query PDU encoder/decoder.

Fixed tagging bug in ResourceReportResponse PDU encoder/decode.

Added SOIF syntax (using private OID for now) to retrieval module and client.

Added Update extended service.

Added SearchResult-1 additional info structure.

Added optional CCL (ISO8777) interpreter as separate module. Available
in linemode client.

--- 1.2 1996/6/10 (1st anniversary release)

Added Summary record syntax. Lightly tested.

Added OPAC record syntax. Untested.

Added ResourceReport service encoders/decoders. Untested.

Fixed bug in z_Unit - wrong tagging on unitSystem.

Fixed bug in the DiagRecs decoder.

Added options for max PDU size and session timeout to frontend-server.

Added documentation of query-language parsers and other supporting utilities.

[frontend-server] Added Attribute set to the bend_scanrequest API.

[frontend-server] NextResultSetPosition was sometimes set incorrectly when
surrogate diagnostics were generated.

[retrieval] Allow multiple local values for attribute.

[retrieval] Allow multiple attributes per element in .abs files. index type.

[retrieval] Added Summary tagset, abstract syntax, and d1-node/ASN filter.

--- 1.1pl2  1996/4/10

Minor changes, mostly specific to Zebra's requirements (retrieval)

--- 1.1  1996/2/20

Repaired bug in frontend server when running multiple listening
endpoints in dynamic mode.

z_External() now won't break if a known, ASN.1 value comes encapsulated
in an octet-string. The value will pass through unmodified in an Odr_oct.

Added a bit of code to the demo client to decode & display
ASN.1-structured records represented in the octet-aligned branch of
the EXTERNAL CHOICE. Thanks to CAS for prodding us to finally do this.

Added z_ext_getentbyref() to the ASN module. Doc updated.

* Completed the SCAN definition in the ASN module. This may break SCAN
code based on older YAZ-versions at compile-time. The fix is easy -
look in proto.h.

* Added 'displayTerm' and OtherInformation to the TermInfo structure
under the SCAN definition. Remember to initialize this, server-people.

Comstack should now support the WAIS protocol in TCP/IP mode. Note
that this does not extend to ODR and ASN.

Comstack allows insertion of established socket (primarily for
inetd-operation of servers). Doc updated.

Front-end server can now start from the inetd in TCP mode. Doc
updated.

--- 1.0pl4 1996/1/24

Added Sort PDU.

Fixed small problem in SUTRS-filter. A newline was sometimes inserted before
the rank and record number.

Adjustments to the frontend server.

Fixed diagnostic BER dumper. It ignored the file argument.

--- 1.0pl3 1996/1/2

Various changes to retrieval module.

Changed the union discriminators of the protocol files from enums to
ints paired with #defines.

*Changed oident.class to oident.oclass to avoid a reserved word in C++
 compilers.

*Changed operator in the RPN structure to 'roperator', again to avoid a
 conflict with C++.

Fixed problems in Explain decoders/encoders.

--- 1.0pl2 1995/12/6

Memory bug in log module fixed.

--- 1.0pl1 1995/12/5

Occasional malloc() of 0 bytes fixed in d1_espec.c.

Bug in Explain DatabaseInfo module fixed.

Some '\r' snuck into one or two of the ret'l config tables. A curse on Windows.

--- 1.0 1995/11/28

The shift to v1.0 signals that we now consider the *core* functionality
of YAZ reasonably stable (the core being more or less equivalent to
Z39.50-1992). Some of the really nifty v3 stuff is still not heavily
tested (Explain not at all - though that will happen soonish).

Minor changes to code to support Windows port.

Various minor changes after we're getting to use GRS-1 & co. more.

Added Espec-1 format.

Added VisibleString field body type to GRS-1. It is illegal acc. to my copy
of the protocol and it cannot be selected when encoding (maps into 'string'
when decoding). Needed to talk to some servers.

Demo client can request simple element set names.

Added Diagnostic Format encoders/decoders.

Added simple Close handling to frontend server (no hooks for resource
reporting yet), and demonstration client.

Added cs_addrstr() command to COMSTACK to retrieve peer hostname/address.

--- 1.0b3 1995/08/24

Fixed bug in the frontend-server. The numberOfRecordsReturned field was
handled incorrectly when records were requested in the searchResponse. This
will only affect you if you use the frontend-server.

Added GRS-1 encoders/decoders to the service-level API. Lightly tested.
Test-client will ask for and print GRS1. Ztest will return dummy records
on request.

Added Explain encoders/decoders to the service-level API. Untested.

Added Extended Services: Item Order encoders and decoders to the Service-
level API. Untested. We could use a recent copy of the pertinent bits
of the ILL protocol to add those bits.

Added diagnostic format 1 encoders/decoders to the service-level API.
Untested.

Moved pretty-printing of structure-wrappers ({..}) from odr_seq.c to
odr_cons.c, which causes a more correct output.

Fixed handling of searchRequest in frontend server. NextResultSetPosition
was always set to 0 when no records were requested in the searchRequest.

* Added better external-handling. This shouldn't harm old code that
*encodes* externals. It can break code that looks for a
'single-ASN1-type' representation, since those types that are known
are now decoded immediately. Look at the SUTRS sample code in
seshigh.c and client.c. Documentation updated.

Handling of structured records in bend_fetchresponse. Length -1 marks
structured record, type is deduced from format field.

--- 1.0b2 1995/06/27
Fairly quick maintenance release to add SUTRS support.

Fixed handling of SUTRS records in the demonstration client.

* Added format field to the bend_fetchrequest and bend_fetchresponce
structures of the backend API (frontend server). When the record is
returned, the value of the format field is mapped to an OID. The
value VAL_SUTRS will also cause a slightly different ASN.1 packaging
of the record. The special value VAL_NONE in the bend_request means
that no specific format was requested by the client. Documentation
updated accordingly. Test server (ztest) will return a fixed dummy
SUTRS record if your client requests SUTRS.

Documentation updated accordingly.

You can now set external libraries and RANLIB support in the top-level
Makefile.

--- 1.0b 1995/06/19
First public release.
