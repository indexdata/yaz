--- XXXX 1995/XX/XX

Fixed bug in the frontend-server. The numberOfRecordsReturned field was
handled incorrectly when records were requested in the searchResponse.

--- 1.0b2 1995/06/27
Fairly quick maintenance release to add SUTRS support.

Fixed handling of SUTRS records in the demonstration client.

* Added format field to the bend_fetchrequest and bend_fetchresponce
structures of the backend API (frontend server). When the record is
returned, the value of the format field is mapped to an OID. The
value VAL_SUTRS will also cause a slightly different ASN.1 packaging
of the record. The special value VAL_NONE in the bend_request means
that no specific format was requested by the client. Documentation
updated accordingly. Test server (ztest) will return a fixed dummy
SUTRS record if your client requests SUTRS.

Documentation updated accordingly.

You can now set external libraries and RANLIB support in the top-level
Makefile.

--- 1.0b 1995/06/19
First public release.
